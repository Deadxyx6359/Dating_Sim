## Description
**C++ Dating Sim** is a console-based interactive narrative game that showcases core C++ concepts while delivering an engaging “choose-your-own-adventure” experience. Players meet and converse with a custom character defined by unique attributes (hair, eye and lip color, skin tone, backstory) and navigate branching dialogue options to build a relationship and unlock different endings. The project illustrates object-oriented design using structs for character data, arrays for dialogue management, and a simple typing-effect routine to enhance immersion.
